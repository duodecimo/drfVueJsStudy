Setting Up a New Application
Go to Django admin and add a new Application with the following configuration:

* client_id and client_secret should be left unchanged
* user should be your superuser
* redirect_uris should be left blank
* client_type should be set to confidential
* authorization_grant_type should be set to 'Resource owner password-based'
* name can be set to whatever you'd like
* The installation is done, you can now test the newly configured application.
